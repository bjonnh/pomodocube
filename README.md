## Software

### Bootloader

I use https://github.com/micronucleus/micronucleus

That way I don't have to move the chip to program it.

### USB

The device uses the last VUSB driver from:
https://www.obdev.at/products/vusb/prjall-de.html

### WS2812

I use a modified (included poorly) light_ws2812 from:

https://github.com/cpldcpu/light_ws2812

# License

All the code is licensed under GPL v3.

If you want to take that for a commercial project (please refer to the
VUSB license if you want to make it closed source) and contact me to
send me samples of your device or saying thank you.
